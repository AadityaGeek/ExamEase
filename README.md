## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or later is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AadityaGeek/ExamEase.git
    cd ExamEase
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key.
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    GENERATE_QUESTIONS_PROMPT="YOUR_CUSTOM_PROMPT"
    ```

### Running the Application

This project requires two services to be running concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI service.

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the application on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit development service (in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This runs the Genkit flows in development mode and allows the frontend to communicate with the AI backend.

Now you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to use the application.
